## Usage
1. Requires an wallet like MetaMask (Connect MetaMask to BSC: https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain)

2. You'll need some test BNB on the BSC Testnet network. Visit a faucet to get some free test BNB. Make sure you've set your wallet network to BSC Testnet.

3. Visit the website link above.

4. Make sure your wallet is on the BSC Testnet. Press the "Connect" button. This will connect the wallet to the app so it can interact with the smart contract. Sadly only the contract owner can release tokens so you'll have to redeploy this contract to get full access.
